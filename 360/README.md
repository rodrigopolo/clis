## Installing dependencies and scripts

### Hugin
To install Hugin, **download it using the `curl` command** to avoid the
headaches macOS provide when downloading something from the internet, open the
image and drag the files to the Applications folder.

Hugin for Apple Silicon / ARM64
```sh
cd
curl -L --progress-bar -O https://bitbucket.org/Dannephoto/hugin/downloads/Hugin-2024.0.1_arm64.dmg
open Hugin-2024.0.1_arm64.dmg
```

Hugin for Intel
```sh
cd
curl -L --progress-bar -O https://bitbucket.org/Dannephoto/hugin/downloads/Hugin-2023.0.0_Intel.dmg
open Hugin-2023.0.0_Intel.dmg
```

### Homebrew
You'll need to install Homebrew, the free and open-source software package
management system for macOS, installations instrucctions are available in the
official Homebrew site: https://brew.sh

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Other dependencies
For this scripts to work, we need to install `exiftool` which makes the scripts able to read image information, and `imagemagick` for image manipulation:
```sh
brew install exiftool imagemagick
```

### Any of the scripts available here
To install any of the scripts, just download it using curl and give it execution
permissions, the script will check for dependencies and show the usage if no
arguments are provided.

## Scripts

### `tocubemap.sh`

To convert an equirectangular panorama `tif` image to 6 separated cube
faces.
```sh
./tocubemap.sh Pano.tif
```

It will produce the following files for each cube face in the same directory
where the input file is, using the file name as a prefix:
```
Pano_Back.tif
Pano_Down.tif
Pano_Front.tif
Pano_Left.tif
Pano_Right.tif
Pano_Up.tif
```

### `toequirectangular.sh`

To convert 6 separated `tif` image cube faces into an equirectangular panorama,
you can call it by setting just one cube face. The script will look for the file
name prefix, then look for the `_Back`, `_Down`, `_Front`, `_Left`, `_Right`
and `_Up` files, and the output file would have the `_equirectangular` suffix:
```sh
./toequirectangular.sh Pano_Front.tif
```

Result:
```
Panorama_equirectangular.tif
```

You can also call it by setting all the cube faces:
```sh
./toequirectangular.sh \
Pano_Back.tif \
Pano_Down.tif \
Pano_Front.tif \
Pano_Left.tif \
Pano_Right.tif \
Pano_Up.tif
```

Installation
```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodrigopolo/clis/refs/heads/main/360/toequirectangular.sh
chmod +x toequirectangular.sh
```

### `add360metadata.sh`
Using `exiftool`, adds the necessary metadata to the `tif` file to be
interpreted as a 360째 panorama. It overwrites the original file:
```sh
./add360metadata.sh Panorama.tif
```

### Geolocation
To set the geolocation of the `tif` file, you can look for the location in
Google Maps, then right-click on the place and select the decimal latitude
and longitude. It will be copied to the clipboard. Then, using the `setlocation`
tool provided in this repo's `bin` directory, call the command, paste the
location, and set the path to the `tif` file:
```sh
setlocation 14.596657575332861, -90.52320360681493 Panorama.tif
```

### Convert to JPG
```sh
./tojpg.sh Panorama.tif
```

### Convert to maximum allowed dimensions for Facebook
```sh
./tofacebookjpg.sh Panorama.tif
```

### Publish
To create the HTML and a multi-resolution cubemap for Pannellum, a lightweight,
free, and open source panorama viewer for the web:
```sh
./topannellum.sh Panorama.tif
```

#### Stitching and merging by rows or lines
The `ptogrid_rows.sh` and `ptogrid.sh` are experimental scripts to deal with huge panoramas, by exporting `pto` files cropping by rows or lines. Options are shown when executing the script without any argument.
```sh
./ptogrid.sh panorama.pto
./ptogrid_rows.sh panorama.pto
```

#### Alternative to `tocubemap.sh`
A faster alternative for `tocubemap.sh` is `kubi`, a cubemap generator based on `libvips`. In fact, it is 4.9x faster than Hugin's `nona`, but lacks the possibility to do the process in reverse, and doesn't calculate the output image size automatically.

To install `kubi` on macOS you'll need to have Python installed, a quick and reliable way to have Python installed is with `pyenv` which can be installed with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install pyenv vips
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

The first command installs `pyenv` and `vips`, the other three add this to the `.zshrc` file:
```
brew install pyenv
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo '[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now that we have `pyenv` installed, we have to install a `Python` version and make it available systemwide:
```sh
pyenv install 3.10.4
pyenv global 3.10.4
```

More information on `pyenv`: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation

Once we have Python and `pip` installed, we install Kubi:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/indus/kubi.git
```

To produce the same results as with `tocubemap.sh`:
```sh
kubi -s 6848 -f Right Left Up Down Front Back Panorama.tif Panorama
```

Here is a wrapper to make Kubi work as `tocubemap.sh`
```sh
./kubi.sh Panorama.tif
```
